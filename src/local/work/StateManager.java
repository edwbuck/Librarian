/*
StateManager will act as the interface between the Brain and the Window; at no point should the Brain OR the
WindowManager be responsible for state management. I.e., if the message, address, or metadata that the program is
looking at changes, the Window will only change its display if the StateManager tells it to. Of course,
that means that StateManager needs to be CONSTANTLY updating.
